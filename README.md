# Infinite breakcore

does what it says on the can

## Setup

1. Download and extract the code .zip at <https://github.com/Elijah/Tyler/Inifnite-breakcore.git>
2. Open Terminal in the project directory and type `python -m pip install -r requirements.txt`

## Run

`python main.py`

It's just randomly generated breakcore, what's not to love?
Feel free to mess around with the config.json file, you can change a lot of attributes about the program.
